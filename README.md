## Setup development environment
### Setup Django application (local)

The first thing to do is to clone the repository:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/blubeyond/tmm.git
$ cd tmm
```

Create a virtual environment to install dependencies in and activate it:

```sh
$ python3 -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
```

Then install the dependencies:

```sh
(env)$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Note the `(env)` in front of the prompt. This indicates that this terminal
session operates in a virtual environment set up by `virtualenv2`.

Once `pip` has finished downloading the dependencies:
```sh
(env)$ python manage.py runserver
```
Next you will need to setup the database.


### Setup Database (local)

Open another terminal window and go to the root directory of the project and run:
```sh
$ docker-compose up postgres
```

Switch back to the terminal window where the virtual env is running and create a superuser.
```sh
(env)$ ./manage.py createsuperuser --username YOUR_SUPERUSER_NAME
```

Once the user is created migrate all the changes to the database
```sh
(env)$ python manage.py migrate
```

All done! After you run the command below the Django application should be visable under: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/`.
```sh
(env)$ python manage.py runserver
```

You should be able use the created superuser credentials to log in to the admin.



## Setup production environment

Open another terminal window and go to the root directory of the project (`/tmm`) and run:
```sh
$ docker-compose up postgres
```

Switch back to the terminal window where the virtual env is running and create a superuser.
```sh
(env)$ ./manage.py createsuperuser --username YOUR_SUPERUSER_NAME
```

Once the user is created migrate all the changes to the database
```sh
(env)$ python manage.py migrate
```

All done! After you run the command below the Django application should be visable under: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/`.
```sh
(env)$ python manage.py runserver
```

You should be able use the created superuser credentials to log in to the admin.
